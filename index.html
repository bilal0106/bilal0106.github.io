            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm Bilal, originally from Syria, currently residing in Jordan. I graduated from the University of 
Jordan in June 2015. My professional journey began with an 8-month tenure at JOVAL, working 
on an ERP system using .NET C# until August 2015. Subsequently, I joined Atlas Limited 
Group as a .NET C# Developer, a role I held from October 2015 to May 2016. My next venture 
was with Acacus Group, where I worked as a .NET developer from June 2017 to September 
2019. I then advanced to a senior position at Omicron Solution, serving from September 2019 to 
October 2020. Following this, I joined Minerets Group as a Senior Developer, a position I held 
from March 2020 to December 2022. Additionally, I have pursued training courses in Dynamics 
365 and .NET Core. My exploration into Python and AI commenced in 2019 alongside my 
pursuit of a master's degree in Computer Engineering, which I am poised to complete by the end 
of this semester.

His expertise in .NET development and his innovative approach to problem-solving have significantly contributed to the success of our projects. Bilal's ability to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders is particularly noteworthy. He is a dedicated and highly skilled developer who consistently exceeds expectations.</p>
            <p class="recommendation-author">- Buthaina Malof, Quality Assurance Manager, Minerets Technologies</p>
			
			<p class="recommendation-text">I have worked with Bilal long enough to see passion, persistence and love for learning.
Although my role was in Human Resources, and Bilal joined in a junior role in the software development team, my interactions with him and what I used to hear from his supervisor were about how he managed to learn, gain new skills, and excel in his work.
None of this would have been possible, if he didn't have the self-motivation and passion to develop.</p>
